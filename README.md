# ClothingExpanded
Clothing Expanded is a mod that lets players carry more accessories, but accessorising their clothes.

* Add a toolbelt to your pants for reduced tool carry weight
* Add crampons to your boots to help with climbing
* Attach a rifle scabbard to your Moose Hide Satchel and lessen the burden of carrying a rifle

Currently, if you were to have all of these items on, you could theoretically have 5 different accessories in effect (Crampons, Toolbelt, Rifle Scabbard, Moose Satchel and whatever you wish the final one to be)

## Installation

* Download the latest version from releases and place the .dll and .modcomponent into the mods folder
* If you want compatibility with Camping Tools, download LeatherworksCT.dll instead of Leatherworks.dll

* Requires [Modder's Tool Box](https://github.com/Jods-Its/Modders-Gear-Toolbox/releases) and [ModComponent](https://github.com/dommrogers/ModComponent) with its dependencies
